Let's start with a point. Turf contains a lot of code that helps you
analyze and combine data sources, but it all starts with data. Use
turf.point to create a point geometry at 0, 0 and output it as JSON.

You'll want to use the `console.log` method to output the point, and
`JSON.stringify` to make it JSON. For instance, here's how you would
make a point at 100, 10.

    var turf = require('turf');

    console.log(JSON.stringify(turf.point([100, 10])));
