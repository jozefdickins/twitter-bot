and the [learnyounode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode/) workshopper
as examples.

## Adding a new exercise:

* Add the exercise as an underscore-separated upper-case string to the `exercises/menu.json`. Like `"MEASURE_AREA"`
* Create a new subdirectory in `exercises`, but lowercase, like `measure_area`
* Copy the contents of the `make_point` exercise over, and
  * `exercise.js` usually can stay the same
  * rewrite `problem.md` to describe the problem to be solved
  * rewrite `solution/solution.js` with code that, when run, outputs the correct answer.
